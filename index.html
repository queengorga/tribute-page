                        <h2>Sir James Paul McCartney</h2>
                        <p>Paul (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the
                        bass guitarist and singer for the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential group in the
                        history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon was the most successful of the post-war era.[2] After
                        the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.</p>
                        
                        <p>McCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles
                        song "Yesterday", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre"
                        is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member
                        of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written,
                        32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009 he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in
                        the United States. McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members of the Order of
                        the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest
                        musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (n√©e
            Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due
            to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. The children
            were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant turned agnostic. Religion
            was not emphasised in the household.</p>
            <br>
            <p>McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams
            Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees,
            he passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary
            modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly
            became friends; McCartney later admitted: "I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger."</p>
