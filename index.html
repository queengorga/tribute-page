                        <h2>Sir James Paul McCartney</h2>
                        <p>Paul (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the
                        bass guitarist and singer for the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential group in the
                        history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon was the most successful of the post-war era.[2] After
                        the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.</p>
                        
                        <p>McCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles
                        song "Yesterday", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre"
                        is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member
                        of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written,
                        32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009 he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in
                        the United States. McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members of the Order of
                        the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest
                        musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>James Paul McCartney was born in Liverpool's Walton Hospital on 18 June 1942. His father Jim worked in the
            cotton trade and played trumpet and piano in jazz and ragtime bands, and his mother Mary worked as a midwife. Paul attended
            the Stockton Wood Road primary school, then went on to the Joseph Williams junior school before passing his 11 Plus in 1953
            and gaining a place at the Liverpool Institute.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The following year, while travelling on a bus to the Institute, he met George Harrison, who was also a student there. 
            In 1955 the McCartneys moved to 20 Forthlin Road, a council house in the Allerton district of Liverpool. It cost them one pound and six shillings a week to live there. The house was bought by the National
            Trust in 1995, and today is a popular tourist destination. Back then, though, it was an unassuming terraced house built by
            the local authority in the 1920s.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On 31 October 1956, Mary McCartney died of an embolism following a mastectomy. She was
            a heavy smoker who had been suffering from breast cancer. The death shook the McCartney family, and later led to a bond between
            Paul and John Lennon, who lost his mother in 1958. Jim McCartney was a keen musician who had been leader of Jim Mac's Jazz
            Band in the 1920s. There was an upright piano in the front room at 20 Forthlin Road, which Jim bought from Harry Epstein's
            NEMS store, which Beatles manager Brian Epstein would later take over.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Jim encouraged Paul and his brother Mike to be musical, and gave Paul a trumpet following the death of his mother. When skiffle became a national craze, however, Paul swapped the
            instrument for a £15 Framus Zenith acoustic guitar. Being left-handed, Paul initially had trouble playing the instrument.
            He later learned to restring it, and wrote his first song, I Lost My Little Girl. He took music lessons for a while, but
            preferred instead to learn by ear. Paul also began playing piano, and wrote When I'm Sixty-Four while still living at Forthlin
            Road. Paul McCartney met John Lennon at the Woolton fete on 6 July 1957, between performances by The Quarrymen. They became
            friends and began writing and performing songs together. McCartney later persuaded Lennon to allow George Harrison into the
            band as lead guitarist in 1958.</p>

                half as nice as some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing. They're not important or famous.
                But they are smart, like my dad was smart. I mean, people who can just cut through problems like a hot knife through butter.
                The kind of people you need in life. Salt of the earth."</i> <br>— Paul McCartney, Playboy interview, 1984</p>

            <h2>The Quarrymen</h2>
            <h3>1957-1960</h3>
            <p>At the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall
            fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and
            folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed
            a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend
            Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.[23] By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals
            and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before
            a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.</p>
            <p>Lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances.
            Some accounts credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting
            the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined
            the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially
            resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison
            attended the Liverpool Institute.</p>
            <p>The group made an amateur recording of themselves in 1958, performing Buddy Holly's "That'll Be the Day" and "In Spite of
            All the Danger", a song written by McCartney and Harrison. The group moved away from skiffle and towards rock and roll, causing
            several of the original members to leave. This left only a trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, who performed under several
            other names, including Johnny and the Moondogs and Japage 3 before returning to the Quarrymen name in 1959. In 1960, the
            group changed its name to the Beatles, and went on to have an extremely successful recording career.</p>

            <img src="img/thebeatles.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>The Beatles</h2>
            <h3>1960-1970</h3>
            <p>The Beatles were informally represented by Allan Williams; in 1960, the group booked its first performance at a residency
            in Hamburg.In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player. While in Hamburg,
            they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English
            singer Tony Sheridan on the single "My Bonnie". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in
            their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August,
            and the band had their first hit, "Love Me Do", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later.</p>
            <p>The fan hysteria became known as "Beatlemania", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the "cute Beatle". 
            In August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet. Included
            on the Help! LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved
            only a single band member.[34] "Yesterday" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that
            year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force
            in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, "from 1965, McCartney would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter,
            but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles." Critics described Rubber
            Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point
            in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song "In My Life". McCartney
            said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand." Recording engineer Norman Smith stated
            that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul
            was becoming obvious and as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky."</p>

            <h2>Wings</h2>
            <h3>1970-1981</h3>
            <p>After the Beatles broke up in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, McCartney, a US number-one
            album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions,
            instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram.</p>
            <p>A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey".
            Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney
            had this to say on the group's formation: "Wings were always a difficult idea, any group having to follow the Beatles'
            success would have a hard job. I found myself in that very position.</p>
            <p>However, it was a choice between going on or finishing,
            and I loved music too much to think of stopping." In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella. Following the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough,
            Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University
            of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities,
            during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding
            Beatles songs during their performances.</p>
            <p>McCartney later said, "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced
            with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as
            good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I
            felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." </p>

            <h2>Solo Career & Collaborations</h2>
            <h3>1981-Present</h3>
            <p>In 1982, McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martin-produced number-one hit "Ebony and Ivory", included on McCartney's Tug of War LP, and with Michael Jackson on "The Girl Is Mine" from Thriller.[119][nb 22] "Ebony and Ivory" was McCartney's record 28th single to hit number one on the Billboard 100.[121] The following year, he and Jackson worked on "Say Say Say", McCartney's most recent US number one as of 2014. McCartney earned his latest UK number one as of 2014 with the title track of his LP release that year, "Pipes of Peace".</p>
            <p>McCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio. The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral.</p>
            <p>In 2000, he released the electronica album Liverpool Sound Collage with Super Furry Animals and Youth, using the sound collage and musique concrète techniques that had fascinated him in the mid-1960s.[164] He contributed the song "Nova" to a tribute album of classical, choral music called A Garland for Linda (2000), dedicated to his late wife.</p>
            <p>In 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[191][nb 45] In July 2011, McCartney performed at two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium. A New York Times review of the first concert reported that McCartney was "not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts."[193] McCartney was commissioned by the New York City Ballet, and In September 2011 he released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called Ocean's Kingdom.[194] Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell.[195] He released Kisses on the Bottom, a collection of standards.</p>
